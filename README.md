## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes.

### Prerequisites

Before running the project, make sure you have Node.js and npm installed on your system. You can download them from [Node.js official website](https://nodejs.org/).

### Installing and Running the Project

Follow these steps to set up your development environment.

1. **Start the Client**

   Navigate to the client directory and install dependencies:

   ```bash
   cd client
   npm install
   ```

   Once the dependencies are installed, you can start the client development server:

   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

   Leave this terminal open to keep the client running.

2. **Start the Server**

   Open a new terminal window. Now, navigate to the server directory and install dependencies:

   ```bash
   cd server
   npm install
   ```

   After the installation, start the server with:

   ```bash
   node --watch index.js
   ```

   Leave this terminal open to keep the server running.

3. **Access the Application**

   Open your web browser and go to the following URL to access the application:

   ```
   http://localhost:5173
   ```

Make sure to keep both the client and server terminals running. Do not close them if you want the application to continue running.
